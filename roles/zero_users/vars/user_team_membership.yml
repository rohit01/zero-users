# This file contains the list of all users and the group of servers, where
# they need to be created. In ansible terminology, you need to define a
# dictionary variable - 'user_team_membership'. The keys should be username
# and value should be the list of inventory groups.
# Here's an example:
#
# user_team_membership:
#   rohit01:
#     - team_admins
#     - team_devops
#   rohit02:
#     - team_ui_ux
#   rohit03:
#     - team_developers
#
# In the above example, we used 'team_' as prefix to separate user management
# groups from usual server management ones. All groups defined above should be
# present in inventory file
#
# If you don't want to create any users, then declare this as an empty
# dictionary variable like below:
#
# user_team_membership: {}
#

# By default, no user is configured to be created.
user_team_membership: {}
